Weather Dashboard Application
This project is a simple weather dashboard application that allows users to search for a city and display its current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representation of the weather.

Objective
The objective of this project is to reinforce understanding of DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming with async/await, loops, and array operations in JavaScript.

Features
API Integration: Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
Search Functionality: Implements a search feature that allows users to enter a city name and retrieve weather data for that location.
Display Weather Data: Uses DOM manipulation to display the cityâ€™s current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon.
Async/Await: Utilizes async/await for API requests to handle asynchronous operations.
Error Handling: Implements error handling for API requests to manage situations where the city is not found or the API is unavailable.
Forecast Display: Displays weather forecast for the next few hours or days.
Toggle Units: Optionally allows users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
